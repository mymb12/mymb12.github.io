## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **Rust:** Ensure you have Rust installed. You can get it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mymb12/chick-chick-customer-site 
    cd chick-chick-customer-site
    ```

2.  **Build and Run the Rust Server:**
    The Rust server will serve the `index.html` and handle API requests for demo submissions.
    ```bash
    cargo build
    cargo run
    ```
    The server will start listening on `http://127.0.0.1:7878` by default.

3.  **Access the Landing Page:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://127.0.0.1:7878`

4.  **(Optional) Second Local Site for "–°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –¥–µ–º–æ" Button:**
    The "–°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—å –¥–µ–º–æ" button is configured to link to `http://127.0.0.1:6564`. If you have another local project running on that port, it will open in a new tab (additionally requires another repo cloned: https://github.com/mymb12/chikc-chick).

## üõ£Ô∏è Potential Future Enhancements

*   Replace placeholder images with actual product/feature visuals.
*   Implement a more robust database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) instead of CSV for storing demo requests.
*   Develop a full-fledged admin interface to view and manage demo requests.
*   Add user authentication.
*   Integrate with email services for sending notifications.
*   Deploy the static front-end to a free hosting provider (Netlify, GitHub Pages).
*   Deploy the Rust backend (or a serverless function alternative) to handle form submissions in a live environment.
*   Add more sophisticated animations and micro-interactions.
*   Implement internationalization (i18n) for multiple languages.
